## Read docs at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs

We intend the docs to be read on gatsbyjs.com â€” You can read them here of course
:-) Just be warned that links won't often work and other things will be missing
or less than optimal.

Go forth and build cool stuff.

## Notes for gatsby-theme-official-docs

This directory includes a spike for creating a theme for our official docs.

- [x] Get MDX docs rendering
- [ ] Switch to yarn for consistency
- [ ] Get custom components
- [ ] Cleanup unnecessary global scope components
- [ ] Set up test site for development
- [ ] Source JSDoc content
- [ ] Create pages for JSDoc API references
- [ ] Add other docs not in `/docs` dir
- [ ] Figure out where events-list is used & cleanup
- [ ] Determine whether MDXProvider is needed in other dotcom pages
- [ ] Docs-specific layout components
- [ ] Test in mansion/dotcom
- [ ] Fix dependency issues (gatsby-interface)
