## Introduction

The introductory paragraph should be a 2-3 sentence explanation of the
main topic and answer the following questions:

What is the purpose of this guide? What will readers have achieved by
following the steps in this guide?

Why is this process worth doing? How will it help readers improve their
Gatsby site?

## Prerequisites

- A Gatsby project set up with `gatsby@5.X.0` or later. (Need help creating one? Follow the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start/))

## Directions

This section should be a step-by-step list of instructions for how readers
can achieve the goal.

1. Do the first thing.
2. Do the next thing.

Use code blocks to show exactly what readers should type. The
Gatsby Style Guide includes tips for best practices when using code
blocks:

If it's a particularly long list of directions, you can split the steps into
sections. Use subheadings to label each chunk. For example:

### Step 1: Do the first thing.

1. The first step of the first thing.
1. The second step of the first thing.

### Step 2: Do some other thing.

1. The first step of some other thing.
1. The second step of some other thing.

## Additional resources

Include other resources you think readers would benefit from or next steps
they might want to take after reading your How-To Guide. You can also
mention any resources that helped you write the article (blog posts, outside
tutorials, etc.).

Best-case scenario, these should be high-quality, evergreen
(not quickly outdated) resources.

- Link to a blog post
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
- Links to relevant plugins
