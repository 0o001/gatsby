# adapters

E2E testing suite for Gatsby's [adapters](http://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/adapters/) feature.
If possible, run the tests locally with a CLI. Otherwise deploy the site to the target platform and run Cypress on the deployed URL.

Adapters being tested:

- [gatsby-adapter-netlify](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-adapter-netlify)
